This could be a handy starting point for chat bots or simple deployment scripts.

Just requires basic user shell permissions and Python 2.7+

## Quick start

* python authrun.py
* Hit the auth protected webserver on its predefined port: http://localhost:9012/
* Default user:pass is `admin:admin`
* See if the shell tails a logfile and creates an empty text file called `works.txt`
* To use further please adjust base64 credentials and adjust shell script for your purposes
